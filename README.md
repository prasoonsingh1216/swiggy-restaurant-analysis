The dashboard includes visualizations such as a gauge chart for average ratings, a map chart for the count of restaurants by area, 
bar charts for average price for two by area and the top areas by count of restaurants, a treemap illustrating the count of restaurants serving different cuisines,

The data used in this dashboard encompasses total cuisines available, number of restaurants, average price for two people, average ratings, 
and areas with the highest counts of restaurants, along with cuisine types and the number of ratings received by restaurants.
